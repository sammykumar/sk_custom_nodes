## JavaScript Module Error Resolution

### Problem

ComfyUI was showing JavaScript errors when trying to load modules from non-existent paths:

```
Error loading extension /extensions/sk_custom_nodes/node_modules/ajv/lib/dotjs/allOf.js
Error loading extension /extensions/sk_custom_nodes/node_modules/ajv/lib/dotjs/multipleOf.js
Error loading extension /extensions/sk_custom_nodes/node_modules/ajv/lib/dotjs/dependencies.js
Error loading extension /extensions/sk_custom_nodes/node_modules/ajv/lib/dotjs/required.js
Error loading extension /extensions/sk_custom_nodes/node_modules/ajv/lib/dotjs/validate.js
Error loading extension /extensions/sk_custom_nodes/node_modules/ajv/lib/dotjs/format.js
Error loading extension /extensions/sk_custom_nodes/node_modules/ajv/lib/dotjs/enum.js
```

### Root Cause

The `web/node_modules` directory contained development dependencies (ESLint, Prettier, etc.) that were accidentally being served by ComfyUI as part of the web extension. ComfyUI was attempting to load these Node.js modules as browser JavaScript files, which is incorrect.

### Solution Applied

1. **Removed `web/node_modules`** - This directory contained development dependencies that shouldn't be exposed to ComfyUI
2. **Removed `web/package-lock.json`** - No longer needed since we're not installing dependencies in the web directory
3. **Kept `web/package.json`** - This is fine for development tool configuration (ESLint, Prettier)

### Architecture Clarification

According to the project structure:

-   **`web/js/gemini_widgets.js`** - Plain JavaScript widgets for ComfyUI (✅ Active)
-   **`web/css/gemini_widgets.css`** - CSS for widgets (✅ Active)
-   **`ui-react_backup/`** - React UI extension (⚠️ Disabled)
-   **Node modules should only exist in**:
    -   Root directory (`node_modules/`) for Playwright tests
    -   React UI directory (`ui-react_backup/ui/node_modules/`) for React build
    -   Test directory (`web/tests/node_modules/`) for Playwright web tests

### Expected Result

After removing the problematic `web/node_modules` directory, ComfyUI should no longer attempt to load the ajv modules that were causing the JavaScript errors. The plain JavaScript widgets will continue to work normally.

### Files Affected

-   ✅ Removed: `/web/node_modules/` (entire directory)
-   ✅ Removed: `/web/package-lock.json`
-   ✅ Kept: `/web/package.json` (for development tools only)
-   ✅ Kept: `/web/js/gemini_widgets.js` (main widget functionality)
-   ✅ Kept: `/web/css/gemini_widgets.css` (widget styling)

### Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Restart ComfyUI server
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Confirm that Gemini nodes load and function correctly

The JavaScript errors should now be resolved since ComfyUI will no longer try to serve the development dependencies as web assets.
